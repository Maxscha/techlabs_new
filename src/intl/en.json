What makes companies like Google, Baidu or Amazon so powerful? It’s the amount of data they possess and the employees that are able to analyze it. The data volume that is created as well as the number of companies that want to use this data growth exponentially every year. There are beautiful and interesting insights hidden in this sea of ever increasing data, waiting to be discovered and Data Science is the key to decipher all these hidden insights. Therefore the demand for data scientists is increasing. Data Science is a pretty versatile field. Data Scientist are demanded in almost ever field you can imagine, such as HealthCare, Banking, Logistics, E-Commerce and many more.
