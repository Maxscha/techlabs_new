            question="What is the main difference between the #codeathome Bootcamp and the Local Digital Shaper Program?"
            answer="Besides the differences stated on our website, the local Digital Shaper Program is a 5 Month Program, which will go much more in depth into your chosen study field. You will have local events with experienced mentors, Premium Online Courses and will complete a whole project with other participants from from your location. The participants have also the option to individualize their track through a questionnaire. This would remove some of the materials you are already skilled in. For example: if you already have Python skills, the curriculum we would assign you, wouldnâ€™t have any introduction to Python materials. The #codeathome Bootcamp is only a comprehensive 2 month program, which participant can do completely online from anywhere in the world. In this Bootcamp we basic track with all materials. This means, if you apply for the Data Science Program and already have some Python skills, you can skip the introduction to Python materials on your own."
