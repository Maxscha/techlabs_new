            text="The  Internet has disrupted our economy and society and millions of people  use the Internet every day. Without Web Developers no content or web  application would exist on the Internet. Companies such as Google or  Amazon wouldn't even exist, as these were born during the era of the  Internet. In the future, web development will be even more important since  technologies have been and will be evolving. Browsers are getting more  powerful day by day or are even used as a whole operating system (e.g., ChromeOS), recent web development toolkits allow you to create native apps on any device.  Think about all those applications you can access on the web from any device anywhere in the world. They have all been created by well-paid web developers that have excellent career prospects. Learning how development for the web works will provide you with powerful and versatile programming skills. These  allow you to create websites, visualize and making data accessible for  users, or just to build an awesome app. Machine Learning, Artificial  Intelligence, Robotics and other domains do often require modern  web-based interfaces to connect with the user or other systems to  provide value. Therefore, having knowledge of web development will  always be an asset for you!"

            text="Our web development track is suited for web development novices and  advanced beginners. As a beginner you will be introduced to the basic  principles of computer science and learn how computers work. You will  also learn more about the tools and technologies that are required for  creating web pages and applications. You will get to know HTML5,  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript. Additionally, you will  learn more about popular frameworks, which are toolsets that help developers to create awesome stuff, and the differences between the term frontend and backend. At the end you will be able to develop  full-stack, both frond- and backend, applications that not just look stunning but can actually help people to do something! 
            As  an advanced beginner you will get to know more advanced web development  techniques and also learn more about software development paradigms.  You will improve your programming skills in JavaScript and use Node.JS  to program blazingly fast applications. If you previously gained some experience in Data Science you will also learn how to efficiently display that data using D3.js."
